# GrowPi
Web based Greenhouse Automation for RaspberryPi

Hello my friends!

Here is Alexander Baese from germany. My goal is to archive a greenhouse automation with the raspberrypi.
First steps for this project were made in 2014 and from there on the developement was very slow or even non-existing.

Now with a refreshed mind i try to push it to a new level. I hope my first step was a good one (join github).
Right now a raw version exists that is working on a stand alone RaspPi. All features that are important to me are included and running fine.

Now to my goal: I have a very clear vision on how the outcome of this project (V1.0?) will look like.
It will be a splitted system that is working local on the RaspPi and remote on the cloud. The cloud will provide the user interface for everyone. From there it will be able to connect the Raspberry Pi as a node for your personal greenhouse.
